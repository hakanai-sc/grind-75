# Grind 75

this is practice for [grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75),
a modern version of the leetcode "blind 75" often used to prepare for
technical interviews. they are the [kata]() of programming i think,
alongside [oo design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
which i hope to complete in my [design-patterns]() repository.

i have done these questions multiple times over but generally forget
them in between interviews. this is here to reference and so i can
memorize their reasons, not just spit out the code pattern.

i will solve them all in typescript first, and then in a different
language.
